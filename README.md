# CS 7643 Project: Hateful Memes

This repository contains the relevant code for a Final Project in CS 7643 at Georgia Tech to classify hateful memes using the Hateful Memes dataset from Meta. 

These notebooks were setup to run on Google Colab with a mounted Google Drive. Additionally, the images/data itself is omitted from this repository, however the code used to pre-process and setup dataloaders remains.
